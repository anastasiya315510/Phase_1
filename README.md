Absolutely! You can **restructure your README** in the same clean, professional style as the *QuakeWatch* example—modular, readable, and production-friendly.

Here’s your updated and organized `README.md` for your Flask Hello World app, following that same format:

# 🌍 Flask Hello World

Flask Hello World is a lightweight, containerized web application built with Flask and served via Gunicorn. It’s ideal as a beginner-friendly example of production-ready container deployment using Docker and Docker Compose.

## 🚀 Features

- **Minimal Flask App**: Basic route returning `Hello, World!`
- **Production-Ready**: Served using Gunicorn instead of Flask's dev server
- **Dockerized**: Easily deployable with Docker and Docker Compose
- **Cross-platform Setup**: Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows environments
- **Portable**: Runs on any system with Docker installed
